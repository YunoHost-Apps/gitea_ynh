Additional informations
-----------------------

### Notes on SSH usage

If you want to use Gitea with ssh and be able to pull/push with you ssh key, your ssh daemon must be properly configured to use private/public keys. Here is a sample configuration of `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` that works with Gitea:

```bash
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile /home/%u/.ssh/authorized_keys
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
```

You also need to add your public key to your Gitea profile.

If you use ssh on another port than 22, you need to add theses lines to your ssh config in `~/.ssh/config`:

```bash
Host domain.tld
    port 2222 # change this with the port you use
```


Architecture: this package is compatible with amd64, i386 and arm. The package will try to detect it with the command uname -m and fail if it can't detect the architecture. If that happens please open an issue describing your hardware and the result of the command `uname -m`.

### Git command access with HTTPS

If you want to use the git command (like `git clone`, `git pull`, `git push`), you need to set this app as **public**.
