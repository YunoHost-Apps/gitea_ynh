## Disclaimers / important information

## Additional informations

### Notes on SSH usage

If you want to use Gitea with SSH and be able to pull/push with your SSH key, your SSH daemon must be properly configured to use private/public keys. Here is a sample configuration `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` that works with Gitea:

```bash
PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile /home/yunohost.app/%u/.ssh/authorized_keys
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
```

You must also add your public key to your Gitea profile.

When using SSH on any port other than 22, you need to add these lines to your SSH configuration `~/.ssh/config`:

```bash
Host domain.tld
    port 2222 # change this with the port you use
```

### Upgrade

By default, a backup is performed before upgrading. To avoid this, you have the following options:
- Pass the `NO_BACKUP_UPGRADE` env variable with `1` at each upgrade. For example `NO_BACKUP_UPGRADE=1 yunohost app upgrade gitea`.
- Set `disable_backup_before_upgrade` to `1`. You can set it with this command:

`yunohost app setting gitea disable_backup_before_upgrade -v 1`

After that, the settings will be applied for **all** the next updates.

From command line:

`yunohost app upgrade gitea`

### Backup

This application now uses the core-only feature of the backup. To keep the integrity of the data and to have a better guarantee of the restoration it is recommended to proceed as follows:

- Stop Gitea service with this command:

`systemctl stop gitea.service`

- Launch Gitea backup with this command:

`yunohost backup create --app gitea`

- Backup your data with your specific strategy (could be with rsync, borg backup or just cp). The data is generally stored in `/home/yunohost.app/gitea`.
- Restart Gitea service with theses command:

`systemctl start gitea.service`

### Remove

Due of the backup core only feature the data directory in `/home/yunohost.app/gitea` **is not removed**. It must be manually deleted to purge user data from the app.

### Git command access with HTTPS

If you want to use the Git command (like `git clone`, `git pull`, `git push`), you need to set this app as **public**.
